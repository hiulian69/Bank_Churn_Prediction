# Bank_Churn_Prediction



A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

This project is about predicting and finding the group of people , who are most likely to churn . We got the dataset of 10127 costumers with 21 features each.
With other words , the main goal of the project is to easearch and find best model and results for predicting the target feature : Attrition_Flag, where 
Existing Customer is 84% and Attrited Costumer is 16% => imbalance that would make it hard for any model to adapt.
